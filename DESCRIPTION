Description: This package provides users with a simple means for accessing the
    spotify using only their client credentials. They can easily convert artist
    and track names into their IDs then use this information to obtain track
    recommendations based on seed artists, genres, and tracks with many optional
    arguments relating to track energy, danceability, tempo, key, acousticness,
    and so on. Users can also pull other track metrics such as track/artist
    popularity, explicit status, and external links.
