Had a meeting with the group to discuss project ideas. We looked at API's, and after a few hours settled on the Spotify API and each members assigned functions.

- I wrote all of the functions for receiving song and artist information. 
- Figured out unit tests and implemented on my code.

- Wrote documentation file
- Altered `getTopSongs` function to optionally return a graphic
- Compiled all functions into one `EricsFunctions.R` script, and put my examples into `EricsFunctionsExamples.Rmd`
