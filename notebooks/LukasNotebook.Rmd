## Feb 8 2021
- Begun working on how to call the API
- Created and registered a spotify application providing client credentials
- Used .gitignore to hide client credentials

- Begun writing out the song recommender function

## Feb 10 2021
- Finished a rough primitive song recommender, authentication function, and
  query assembler to help procress all 47 potential arguments to the song recommender

## Feb 14 2021
- Decided to add an artist to ID and track to ID conversion function to let
  users more easily take advantage of the song recommender. They no longer
  need to manually search for IDs to use in the song recommender. Hopefully
  these ID converters can be integrated into the song recommender.

## Feb 16 2021
- Updated project structure by creating an .Rproj file for package structuring.
  07c062e0f11d43003fc41ee6069a349ea7aba188
- Added documentation to my functions and wrote a description for the package.

## Feb 17 2021
- Test writing complete. Users no longer need to use artist IDs in the song
  recommender, it will automatically find the artist ID based on the name(s)
  used.

- Added many error handling aspects to my functions so they can deal with:
  - invalid or rundefined authentication tokens
  - no search returns for artist ID, track ID, and song recommendations

## Feb 18 2021
- Decided collectively to hardcode in the API credentials since tests scripts
  were unable to run API calls outside of testthat statements. Now every function
  call will call on get_athentication_token using the hardcoded credentials. This
  also eliminates the possibility for undefined or expired tokens since they're
  always called fresh. I updated Erics and Adityas test scripts and R scripts
  to account for this.

- Fixed errors in testscript formatting.

- Updated names of package scripts to better reflect their functionality

## Feb 19 2021
- Reviewed all our code, split my functions and tests into multiple scripts
  for easy reference. Removed library calls in scripts for everyone and
  replaced it with inline library calling (package::function()). Edited tests
  and cleaned up functions so there's no reducndancy across our code base.
